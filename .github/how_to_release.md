# How to release gdal-grass

1. Release tag must be created on CLI (letting GitHub create the tag in
   connection with with GH online publish will **not** create and archive
   the release files):

```bash
git switch main
git pull
git status

# Set version, do not forget!
version="x.y.z"

# Assuming 'upstream' points to the OSGeo fork
commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
tag_message="gdal-grass ${version}"
git tag -a -m "${tag_message}" $version $commit
git push -u --tags upstream
```

2. Create a new release on GH, based on the above created tag. "Publish release"
   will activate the *publish.yml* workflow, which will create and add the
   packages to the release.

3. Transfer the packaged files to https://download.osgeo.org/gdal-grass/.
